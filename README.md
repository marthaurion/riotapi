Riot API Tests
==============

Messing around with the Riot API in Java and MySQL.

Stuff to do:
- Might want to consider waiting until we find a match that isn't in the database before we pull summoner league information to save an API call.
- Automate running of the program to fill database.
- Create a generalized function to add new columns to the database.
- Create a generalized function to add summoners to the database and mark friends.
- For some reason an ign caused a duplicate key error. Might want to look into that.
